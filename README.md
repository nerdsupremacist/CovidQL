# CovidQL
GraphQL API for querying data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

## How does this work

![](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/GraphZahl/raw/master/logo.png)
This was made using [GraphZahl](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/GraphZahl) and [Vapor](https://vapor.codes).

It's querying [NovelCOVID](https://github.com/novelcovid/api) which is itself querying [Worldmeter](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

It's also delivering news for covid in each country using (NewsAPI)[https://newsapi.org].
